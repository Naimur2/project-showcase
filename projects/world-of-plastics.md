## About<a name = "about"></a>

A multivendor plastic selling website is a platform where multiple vendors can sell plastic products to customers. This website has been built using Next.js for the frontend and Redux.js for state management. The data for the website has been fetched using RTK Query for React. This website provides a convenient way for customers to purchase plastic products from multiple vendors in a single platform, and for vendors to reach a wider audience and sell their products effectively.
