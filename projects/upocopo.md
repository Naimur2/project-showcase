## Libraries Used In this project <a name = "technologies"></a>

A React Native application that allows users to bid on buying NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on a blockchain platform. NFTs are unique digital assets that are authenticated using blockchain technology, making them valuable and highly sought-after. Your application provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and bidding on available NFTs. Users can view details about each NFT, such as its name, description, and current bidding price, as well as place their own bids on the item. The app also provides notifications to alert users when they have been outbid, helping to keep them up to date on the status of their bids. This application has the potential to open up new possibilities for buying and selling unique digital assets, and could be particularly appealing to collectors and investors who are interested in the world of blockchain and NFTs.
